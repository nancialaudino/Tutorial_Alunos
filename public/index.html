     and <span style="color:rgb(4, 247, 4);font-weight:bold">students</span> saving you 
     <span style="color:rgb(250, 2, 147);font-weight:bold">time</span> and <span style="color:rgb(248, 1, 145);font-weight:bold">money</span>.</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous 
    indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by 
    the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that 
    they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; 
    and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through 
    weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
    from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
    distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
    and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, 
    every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
    circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business
    it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances 
    accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
    of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,
    or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
